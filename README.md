# 1337_42_snow-crash-SECURITY
 This project will be an introduction to cyber security.

## Introduction
As a developer, you may have to work on softwares that will be used by hundreds of persons in your career.  
If your software shows some weaknesses, these weaknesses will expose the users through your software.  
It is your duty to understand the different techniques used to exploit these weaknesses in order to spot them and avoid them.  
This project is a modest introduction to the wide world of cyber security.  
A world where you’ll have no margin for errors.  

## Objectives
This project aims to make you discover, through several little challenges, cyber security in various fields.  
You will use more or less complex methods that will give you a new perspective on IT in general.  
You will reach some stalemate during this project. You will have to surpass them yourself.  
You must be the one and ONLY key to the locked doors you will face.  
This project aims to develop some logic thinking you will learn for good and use in the future.  
Before asking for help, ask yourself if you’ve really explored all the possibilities.
