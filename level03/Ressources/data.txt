level03 is a binary file which his user is flag03

and also have 's' (set user ID) in his permissions 
This is a special permission bit that allows the program, when run by any user, to be run with the effective UID of the owner of the file

after decompiling it via : Retdec

i found this code :

====

#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int32_t v1 = getegid(); // 0x80484ad
    int32_t v2 = geteuid(); // 0x80484b6
    setresgid(v1, v1, v1);
    setresuid(v2, v2, v2);
    return system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me");
}

====

so the program get the effective user id (flag03 in this case) and group id and store them v1,v2
and set the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the current process to v1,v2

now the programs runs with flag03 userid

after that the program call system and use env to call echo 

i write a small program to call /bin/bash i named it echo and saved it in /tmp/var/echo

after, i changed the PATH from the environement to look first for binaries in /tmp/var

i executed the program level03 and he executed my echo(/bin/bash) located in /tmp/var with with the userid flag03
